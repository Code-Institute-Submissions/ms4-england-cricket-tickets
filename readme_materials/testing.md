## Validation

The W3C Markup and CSS Validator Services, JSHint and Python Validator were used to validate every page of the project 
to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fms3-tips.herokuapp.com%2F)
    This same result appears across every page of the site.

-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fms3-tips.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) -  
    There is 1 property issue found when checking the site. However, these are being validated from the Materialize 
    link and therefore out of my control.

## Autoprefixer CSS Online

This was used to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes in order to ensure that the CSS styling works properly across all 
browsers. I have added the below header to my CSS styles sheet in order to show this:

## Lighthouse

<p >Desktop<img src="documentation/screenshots/lighthouse.jpg">
Mobile<img src="documentation/screenshots/lighthouse-mobile.jpg"></p>

From Chrome Developer Tools, this Lighthouse score is based on the homepage while being viewed on desktop and mobile. The 
biggest variant throughout the site is the performance score, which is predominantly due to the image link added by users 
to the site for each individual Tip, making it quite hard to control.
