# MS4: England Cricket Tickets.

[View the live project here.](https://adamdelancey.github.io/ms4-england-cricket-tickets)

As my fourth and final submission for the Code Institute, this England Cricket Tickets website is an online store where users can purchase
tickets for England Cricket matches around the globe. They can select the day they want to visit, which stand, and how many tickets they would 
like to purchase. They can login to their accounts to see what tickets they have bought, read FAQs, and receive emails to notify them that new 
tickets have been added. The owner of the website will be able to create, read, update and delete new tours and tickets in order to keep the website 
updated. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it interactive and easy to navigate for potential users.

-   Python

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

*********************************************************
1. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/1)
    - MongoDB was used to host the data used on the site and was chosen due to the non-relational nature of the data.
1. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
    - The Flask framework was used to import the Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, session, and url_for 
    functions that are used throughout the site.
1. [BSon](http://bsonspec.org/)
    - This was imported in order to access the data used across the site.
1. [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/)
    - This was imported in order for the password control to enhance security on the site.
1. [Jinja Templating](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/)   
    - This was used predominantly for the with, for loops and if statements in order to display all of the relevant data.
1. [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - I have used JQuery predominantly to initialise the components used in the Materialize framework. In addition, I used 
    code taken from the Data Centric Development Module with the Code Institute in order to ensure that the category names are 
    a required attribute.
1. [Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/)
    - Materialize was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website, such as the navbars for desktop and 
    mobile, buttons, forms, cards and colours.
1. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used to import the 'Sarala' font which is used on all pages throughout the project.
1. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes. 
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
1. [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
    - Heroku is used for the hosting of the site and is deployed through here.
1. [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

# Testing

## Validation

The W3C Markup and CSS Validator Services, JSHint and Python Validator were used to validate every page of the project 
to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fms3-tips.herokuapp.com%2F)
    This same result appears across every page of the site.
    <p> <img src="documentation/screenshots/html-checks.jpg">  </p> 
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fms3-tips.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) -  
    There is 1 property issue found when checking the site. However, these are being validated from the Materialize 
    link and therefore out of my control.
    <p> <img src="documentation/screenshots/css-validator.jpg">  </p> 
-   [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) - 
    No issues were found on this check.
    <p> <img src="documentation/screenshots/jshint.jpg"></p>      
-   [Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/)
    No issues were found on this check.
    <p> <img src="documentation/screenshots/pep8.jpg"></p>   
    

## Autoprefixer CSS Online

This was used to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes in order to ensure that the CSS styling works properly across all 
browsers. I have added the below header to my CSS styles sheet in order to show this:
<p> <img src="documentation/screenshots/css-prefixer.jpg">  </p>

## Lighthouse

<p >Desktop<img src="documentation/screenshots/lighthouse.jpg">
Mobile<img src="documentation/screenshots/lighthouse-mobile.jpg"></p>

From Chrome Developer Tools, this Lighthouse score is based on the homepage while being viewed on desktop and mobile. The 
biggest variant throughout the site is the performance score, which is predominantly due to the image link added by users 
to the site for each individual Tip, making it quite hard to control.

# Deployment

Tips was developed using GitPod, using Git and GitHub to host the repository.

## Cloning Tips from GitHub ##

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

In addition, create an account on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in order to create the database.

1. Clone the repository by either downloading from [my GitHub Page](https://github.com/adamdelancey/ms3-tips), or if you
already have Git installed, by typing the following command into your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamdelancey/ms3-tips
```

2. Navigate to this folder in your terminal window and install the required modules to run the application using the following command:

```bash
python -m pip -r requirements.txt
```

3. Initialise the virtual environment by typing the following command into the terminal:

```
py -m venv virtual
```

4. In MongoDB, create a new database called tips with three collections: categories, tips and users.

5. Back in GitPod create a file to hold your environment variables and call it env.py.

6. Your env.py file should contain the following:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "YOUR_MONGODB_URI")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME")
```

- Make sure you update the secret keys and passwords.

- Before pushing the project to a public repository, add your env.py file to .gitignore.

7. You can now run your application locally by typing the following command into your terminal:

```
python run.py
```

## Deploying Tips to Heroku ##

1. Log in to Heroku and click create new app.

2. Create a requirements.txt file using the following command in GitPod:

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. Create a Procfile with the following command:

```
echo web: python run.py > Procfile
```

4. Push these newly created files to your repository master.

5. Add heroku remote to your git repository by getting the heroku git URL from the heroku account settings. Then type the
following: 

```
git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/xxxxx
```

6. Push the page to your heroku account:

```
git push heroku master
```

7. In your heroku app, set the following variables:

Key|Value
:-----:|:-----:
HOSTNAME|0.0.0.0
PORT|5000
MONGO_URI|YOUR_MONGODB_URI
SECRET_KEY|YOUR_SECRET_KEY

Again, make sure to enter your own SECRET_KEY, and MONGO_URL.

8. Click the deploy button on the Heroku dashboard.
9. The site has been deployed to Heroku.
